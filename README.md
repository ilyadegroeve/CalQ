# CalQ

CalQ is a cross-platform GUI-based physics formula solver that leverages **PyQt6**, **Sympy**, and **SciPy** to evaluate mathematical and physics equations effortlessly. It intelligently substitutes physical constants and previously computed variables, while also allowing you to customize themes and decimal precision.

## Features

- **Interactive Formula Solver:** Input equations, and CalQ will solve for the unknown variable using symbolic algebra.
- **Physics & Engineering Constants:** Choose from a comprehensive list of scientific constants (including constants from SciPy and Euler's number).
- **Variable Memory:** Save and reuse previous results in your calculations.
- **Customizable Theme:** Toggle between Light, Dark, or System theme modes.
- **Adjustable Precision:** Set the number of decimal places for the computed solutions.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Quick access to common actions such as saving to memory (`Ctrl+S`), clearing memory (`Ctrl+Q`), opening settings (`Ctrl+I`), and toggling full-screen (`F11`).

## Installation
